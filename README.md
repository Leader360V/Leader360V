## About Leader360V

- Leader360V is the first large-scale (10K+), labeled real-world 360 video datasets for instance segmentation and tracking. Our datasets enjoy high scene diversity, ranging from indoor and urban settings to natural and dynamic outdoor scenes.

- All videos in this dataset have undergone standardized preprocessing, including video clipping, facial anonymization for privacy protection, and balanced scene distribution across categories.

- Regarding dataset composition, we integrated existing 360 video datasets (either unlabeled or annotated for single tasks) and supplemented them with newly collected self-recorded videos. All content was then re-annotated to support joint segmentation and tracking tasks.

- **Due to the large size of the dataset, we have currently uploaded only a selection of demos. We plan to upload all files at a later date to facilitate community research.**
